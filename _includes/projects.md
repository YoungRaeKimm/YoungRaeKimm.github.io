  This project aims to act as the intermediary layer between the communication layer and the interface layer, much like the role of an operating system between the hardware layer and the application layer in a computer system. In this context, we refer to this intermediary layer as "mOS." The primary objectives of mOS includes the construction of a data pipeline, data processing, and automated decision-making. Specifically, our team has focused on enhancing two kinds of efficiency: computational efficiency and data efficiency.</autocolor></li>

To address computational efficiency, our team has concentrated on optimizing the vision models utilized in traffic systems. This optimization involves compressing these models and exelarating their computational processes.</autocolor></li>

Furthermore, we've tackled data efficiency from two angles: 1) We have implemented mechanisms for aggregating knowledge from edge devices. This approach allows us to acquire federated knowledge, granting each edge device aader perspective; 2) We've introduced generalizable and adaptable knowledge into edge devices. This empowers edge devices to seamlessly adapt to new environments with minimal overhead.</autocolor></li>

My paper, titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14334.pdf">MetaWeather: Few-Shot Weather-Degraded Image Restoration via Degradation Pattern Matching</a>, is about building adaptive knowledge through the utilization of meta-learning and few-shot learning techniques. In aspect of real-world scenario, the motivation of this research is to enhance the quality of weather-degraded images for vision applications, such as object detection and tracking models, ensuring that they receive clean inputs for more accurate results.</autocolor></li>
