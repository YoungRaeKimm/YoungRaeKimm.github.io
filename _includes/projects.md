  This project aims to act as the intermediary layer between the communication layer and the interface layer, much like the role of an operating system between the hardware layer and the application layer in a computer system. In this context, we refer to this intermediary layer as "mOS."


The primary objectives of mOS encompass the construction of a data pipeline, data processing, and automated decision-making. Specifically, our team has placed significant emphasis on enhancing two key aspects: computational efficiency and data efficiency.


To address computational efficiency, our team has focused on optimizing the vision models utilized in traffic systems. This optimization involves compressing these models and exploring their computational processes to streamline their performance.


Furthermore, we've tackled data efficiency from two angles:
1. We have implemented mechanisms for aggregating knowledge from edge devices. This approach allows us to acquire federated knowledge, granting each edge device a broader perspective.
2. We've introduced generalizable and adaptable knowledge into edge devices. This empowers edge devices to seamlessly adapt to new environments with minimal overhead.


My research paper, titled "MetaWeather," delves into the concept of building adaptive knowledge through the utilization of meta-learning and few-shot learning techniques. The ultimate objective of this research is to enhance the quality of weather-degraded images for vision applications, such as object detection and tracking models, ensuring that they receive clean inputs for more accurate results.
