  <li><autocolor>This project aims to provide the middle layer between communication layer and interface layer, similarly with the role of operating system between hardware layer and application layer.
  Therfore, mOS includes building data pipeline, data processing, and making decision automatically.
  Particularly, our team focused on the two types of efficiency: computational efficiency; data efficiency. 
  To deal with the computational efficiency, our team has delved into the compression of vision models deployed acorss traffic systems and exelarating the computation processes of them.
  In addition, we handled the data efficiency considering two aspects of it: 1) aggregating knowledges from the edge devices so that in aspect of one edge device, it can acquire federated knowledge; 2) injecting generalizable, adaptable knowledge into the edge devices so that edge device can adapt to new environment with less burden.
  My MetaWeather paper is about building adaptable knowledge with meta-learning and few-shot learning, of which goal is delevering clean version of weather-degraded images to vision application models such as object detection and tracking models.
