## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC). Previously, I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) under the supervision of Prof. Dongman Lee.
<!-- I'm an M.S. candidate at School of Computing, <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</a>, advised by <a href="http://cds.kaist.ac.kr/cdsn/?p=29">Prof. Dongman Lee</a>.  -->
<!-- Previously, I was advised by <a href="https://apl.hongik.ac.kr/professor">Prof. Young Yoon</a> in the Department of Computer Engineering, <a href="https://en.hongik.ac.kr/index.do">Hongik University</a>.  -->

## Research Interests

<!-- - **Computer Vision:** image/video understanding, general purpose vision model
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, transfer learning, representation learning -->
**Areas: Computer Vision, Machine Learning**

- Controllable representation learning: Modern visual models contain biased and difficult-to-understand representations, leading to potentially catastrophic results. I am interested in developing a learning framework for unbiased, interpretable, and general visual representations.
- Optimization through interaction with the surroundings: Although a large dataset is used to train the model, the extremely dynamic real world contains a distribution of blind spots that typical models cannot address. I am interested in detecting this gap and optimizing a model by interacting with its surroundings.
