## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California (USC)</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Jay">Prof. Jay Kuo</a>. I previously earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://cds.kaist.ac.kr/people/dongmanlee/">Prof. Dongman Lee</a>.

## Research Interests

<!-- - **Computer Vision:** image/video understanding, general purpose vision model
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, transfer learning, representation learning -->
**Areas: Computer Vision, Multi-Modality, Machine Learning**

- <strong>Controllable representation learning </strong>: Modern AI models contain biased and non-transparent representations, leading to potentially catastrophic results. I am interested in developing a learning framework for unbiased, interpretable, and versatile representations.
- <strong>Optimization through interaction with the surroundings</strong>: Although a large dataset is used to train the model, the extremely dynamic real world contains a distribution of blind spots that typical models cannot address. I am interested in detecting this gap and optimizing a model by interacting with its surroundings.
